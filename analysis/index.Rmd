# Summary

Objective of this analysis is to refresh the IITA genomic predictions for all available germplasm, but especially adding the 45 trials listed by Ismail Rabbi on Sep. 14, 2020 (printed below). Clones are already planted in a mixed crossing block in Ubiaja and the new set of GEBV and GETGV will be used for selecting parents and crosses. 

We may try optimal contributions. For now skip cross-validation.

# Analysis Steps

1. [Prepare a training dataset](01-cleanTPdata.html): Download data from DB, "Clean" and format DB data.
2. [Curate by trait-trial](02-curateByTrial.html): Model each trait-trial separately, remove outliers, get BLUPs.
3. [Get BLUPs combining all trial data](03-GetBLUPs.html): Combine data from all trait-trials to get BLUPs for downstream genomic prediction.
4. **SKIP FOR NOW** [Check prediction accuracy](04-CrossValidation.html): Evaluate prediction accuracy with cross-validation.
5. [Genomic prediction](05-GetGBLUPs.html): Predict _genomic_ BLUPs (GEBV and GETGV) for all selection candidates using all available data.
6. **SKIP FOR NOW** [Estimate genetic gain](06-GetGainEst.html)

# Other details

From Ismail Rabbi on 14 Sep. 2020:  

> We finished uploading to cassavabase the trials harvested so far. A few trials remain but we cant wait for them since flowering in Ubiaja is kicking in.
